Any standard Python library can be used, so far that the library is free and can be simply installed using `pip` or `conda`. Examples of potentially useful libraries are `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `gensim`, `nltk`, `spaCy`, and `AllenNLP`. Use the latest stable version of each library.\n",

The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes. The provided dataset contains the classes (labels) referring to the humanitarian sectors like agriculture, health, and protection. The dataset contains an overall number of 17,301 data points. \n",

The price of <num> bags of fertilizers such as urea and phosphorous averaged SYP <num> (USD16) and SYP <num> (USD10) respectively. The cost of irrigation varied by governorate and crops.
